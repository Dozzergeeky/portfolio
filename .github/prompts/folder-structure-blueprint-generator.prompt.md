## Generated Prompt

"Analyze the project's folder structure and create a comprehensive 'Project_Folders_Structure_Blueprint.md' document that serves as a definitive guide for maintaining consistent code organization. Use the following approach:

### Initial Auto-detection Phase

${PROJECT_TYPE == "Auto-detect" ? 
"Begin by scanning the folder structure for key files that identify the project type:
- Look for solution/project files (.sln, .csproj, .fsproj, .vbproj) to identify .NET projects
- Check for build files (pom.xml, build.gradle, settings.gradle) for Java projects
- Identify package.json with dependencies for JavaScript/TypeScript projects
- Look for specific framework files (angular.json, react-scripts entries, next.config.js)
- Check for Python project identifiers (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml)
- Examine mobile app identifiers (pubspec.yaml, android/ios folders)
- Note all technology signatures found and their versions" : 
"Focus analysis on ${PROJECT_TYPE} project structure"}

${IS_MONOREPO == "Auto-detect" ? 
"Determine if this is a monorepo by looking for:
- Multiple distinct projects with their own configuration files
- Workspace configuration files (lerna.json, nx.json, turborepo.json, etc.)
- Cross-project references and shared dependency patterns
- Root-level orchestration scripts and configuration" : ""}

${INCLUDES_MICROSERVICES == "Auto-detect" ? 
"Check for microservices architecture indicators:
- Multiple service directories with similar/repeated structures
- Service-specific Dockerfiles or deployment configurations
- Inter-service communication patterns (APIs, message brokers)
- Service registry or discovery configuration
- API gateway configuration files
- Shared libraries or utilities across services" : ""}

${INCLUDES_FRONTEND == "Auto-detect" ? 
"Identify frontend components by looking for:
- Web asset directories (wwwroot, public, dist, static)

- Note any structural patterns that repeat throughout the codebase
- Document the rationale behind the structure where it can be inferred

${IS_MONOREPO == "Auto-detect" ?

IS_MONOREPO ? "Explain how the monorepo is organized and the relationship between projects." : ""}

${INCLUDES_MICROSERVICES == "Auto-detect" ? 
"If microservices are detected, describe how they are structured and organized." : 
INCLUDES_MICROSERVICES ? "Describe how the microservices are structured and organized." : ""}

### 2. Directory Visualization

${VISUALIZATION_STYLE == "ASCII" ? 
"Create an ASCII tree representation of the folder hierarchy to depth level ${DEPTH_LEVEL}." : ""}

${VISUALIZATION_STYLE == "Markdown List" ?
