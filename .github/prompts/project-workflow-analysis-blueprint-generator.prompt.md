## Generated Prompt

```
"Analyze the codebase and document ${WORKFLOW_COUNT} representative end-to-end workflows 
that can serve as implementation templates for similar features. Use the following approach:
```

### Initial Detection Phase

```
${PROJECT_TYPE == "Auto-detect" ? 
  "Begin by examining the codebase structure to identify technologies:
   - Check for .NET solutions/projects, Spring configurations, Node.js/Express files, etc.
   - Identify the primary programming language(s) and frameworks in use
   - Determine the architectural patterns based on folder structure and key components" 
  : "Focus on ${PROJECT_TYPE} patterns and conventions"}
```

```
${ENTRY_POINT == "Auto-detect" ? 
  "Identify typical entry points by looking for:
   - API controllers or route definitions
   - GraphQL resolvers
   - UI components that initiate network requests
   - Message handlers or event subscribers

### Implementation Guidelines

Based on the documented workflows, provide specific guidance for implementing new features:

#### 1. Step-by-Step Implementation Process
- Where to start when adding a similar feature
- Order of implementation (e.g., model → repository → service → controller)
- How to integrate with existing cross-cutting concerns

#### 2. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Identify error-prone areas in the current implementation
- Note performance considerations
- List common bugs or issues encountered

#### 3. Extension Mechanisms
- Document how to plug into existing extension points
- Show how to add new behavior without modifying existing code
- Explain configuration-driven feature patterns

**Conclusion:**
Conclude with a summary of the most important patterns that should be followed when 
implementing new features to maintain consistency with the codebase."
