      <h2>What I invest in</h2>
      <p>
        I write small checks in <strong>developer-first startups</strong>. I
        prefer folks who are in early stages (think pre-seed or seed) and
        products that increase productivity, avoid task repetition, or unlock
        revenue potential.
      </p>

      <h2>What you get from me</h2>
      <p>I love helping with...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Product</strong> - being "user zero" for new features,
          providing feedback, and figuring out priorities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Branding</strong> - building a company brand that developers
          love, admire, and get inspired by.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recruiting</strong> - leveraging my personal network to
          attract talented engineers and designers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enterprise</strong> - sharing my experience moving upmarket
          (what works and what doesn't).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Open Source</strong> - defining a strategy that will help with
          monetization and hiring.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who took my money</h2>
      <p>I've been grateful to work with these companies as an investor.</p>
